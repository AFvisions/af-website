    <h3 style="color: #ffffff;">Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Carnation Bridge is a funeral planning app designed to guide individuals through emotionally difficult moments with clarity and compassion.
      We built a resource-rich, decision-simplifying tool to support immediate-need funeral planning, offering guidance, vendor discovery,
      and emotional support tools in one place.
    </p>
  
    <h3 style="color: #ffffff;">The Problem</h3>
    <p>
      Funeral planning often happens at a time of shock, grief, and uncertainty. Most families aren’t prepared, especially when arrangements haven’t
      been pre-planned. The result is stress, confusion, and difficulty making informed choices.
    </p>
  
    <h3 style="color: #ffffff;">The Solution</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Location- and budget-based funeral home search</li>
      <li>AI-powered chat guidance</li>
      <li>Grief counseling resources</li>
      <li>Step-by-step checklists</li>
      <li>Price transparency and service comparisons</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3 style="color: #ffffff;">Research & Discovery</h3>
    <p>
      We conducted user interviews with three key user types: those who had never planned a funeral, those who had pre-planned,
      and those who had done so recently after a death. Interviews were guided by a script designed for empathy and sensitivity.
    </p>
  
    <h3 style="color: #ffffff;">Persona: Meet Diane</h3>
    <p>
      Diane is planning a funeral for her late father with limited funds and no pre-arrangements. She needs help organizing tasks,
      securing financial support, and honoring her father’s wishes on a tight timeline.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Wants:</strong> A respectful, non-religious memorial; to follow her father's wishes</li>
      <li><strong>Needs:</strong> Financial assistance; organization tools; funeral within 3 weeks</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3 style="color: #ffffff;">Journey Mapping</h3>
    <p>
      We mapped the emotional and logistical landscape of an unprepared funeral planner and found stress peaks during document collection,
      vendor research, and cost estimation.
    </p>
  
    <h3 style="color: #ffffff;">The Breakthrough</h3>
    <p>
      Our initial solution was overly broad — trying to handle everything. It wasn’t until we mapped the journey that we realized the most critical opportunity:
    </p>
    <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #567a75; padding-left: 1em; color: #ffffff;">
      <strong>⚡ Helping users connect with the right funeral home as early as possible.</strong>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      That insight allowed us to tighten the scope and build around a core experience: <strong>calm, guided, human-first support</strong> during urgent funeral planning.
    </p>
  
    <h3 style="color: #ffffff;">UX Flow & Prototyping</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Search funeral homes by ZIP code and budget</li>
      <li>View and compare filtered results</li>
      <li>AI chat support to assist with decisions</li>
      <li>Appointment scheduling feature</li>
      <li>Accessibility improvements based on feedback</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3 style="color: #ffffff;">My Contributions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Initiated project concept and led team coordination</li>
      <li>Co-led research and wrote interview script</li>
      <li>Designed visual assets and helped build the prototype</li>
      <li>Structured and co-wrote the final presentation</li>
      <li>Provided design support and feedback to the full team</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3 style="color: #ffffff;">Future Development</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Vendor comparisons and side-by-side views</li>
      <li>Improved appointment scheduling</li>
      <li>Smarter search features and UI polish</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3 style="color: #ffffff;">Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      Carnation Bridge taught me that clarity comes from empathy and focus. By narrowing the problem space and leading with user stories,
      we created something both helpful and emotionally respectful. This project sharpened my UX process and reinforced my commitment
      to user-first design.
